<p><em><strong>Sesame Kale Salad</strong> – serves 4 to 6 as a side dish (or 2 people if you're Helen and me!)</em></p>
<ul>
<li>1 pound of kale leaves once the tough stems &amp; ribs are removed and roughly chopped – I used the prebagged &amp; washed variety</li>
<li>2 large roasted piquillo peppers or roasted red bell peppers, cut into thin, bite-sized strips</li>
<li>3 tablespoons toasted sesame seeds</li>
<li>1/4 cup rice wine vinegar</li>
<li>2 tablespoons toasted sesame oil</li>
<li>2 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
</ul>
<p>- In a small bowl, whisk together the sesame oil, soy sauce and vinegar until completely emulsified. Set aside at room temperature.</p>
<p>- In a larger mixing bowl, place kale and pepper strips. Drizzle in dressing and mix the greens and dressing thoroughly – I used my hands for this. Sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds and mix once more until evenly distributed. Cover bowl with its lid or well fitting plastic wrap. Chill for 4 hours to overnight. </p>
