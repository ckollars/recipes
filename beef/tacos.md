## Ingredients:
- 2 pounds lean ground beef
- 1 teaspoon salt
- 1 teaspoon chili powder
- 2 teaspoons cumin
- 1 teaspoon garlic powder
- 1 onion, minced

Water or beef broth, enough to cover the meat edit: I highly recommend using only beef broth it really gives the best flavor

## Directions:
Place all ingredients in a large pan over high heat. Bring to boil. Turn down to medium/medium low heat and simmer for 1 hour. Use a potato masher to break apart the meat.

Strain away any leftover liquid. If you are making this ahead of time you can place the leftover liquid in the fridge to harden the grease. Spoon off any hardened grease and add a little liquid back to the meat if you are reheating it.

When reheating in a slow cooker  add in a 1/2 cup of beef broth to keep the meat moist.
